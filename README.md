# Design-of-Low-Dropout-Regulator
A 130 nM CMOS low-dropout (LDO) Voltage Regulator is proposed in this paper for battery-operated measurement system. With the quiescent current of only 7 uA, it supplies a 1.8 V output voltage from a 3.6 V to 1.9 V battery input voltage, featuring a line regulation of 0.00 647 mV/V  and a load regulation of 0.0024 mV/mA for a load current of 50 mA over 100 pF load
